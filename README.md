# Potato leaf disease prediction

In this project CNN architeture is used to detect disease in potao leaf and classify the types of disease as Early Blightor Late Blight. If leaf does not have any disease then trained model classify as Healthy.This project can help farmers to easly detect the disease and start medication accordingly.

## Lessons Learned
This project helped me to further extend my thoughts on how CNN architecture works and proper architecture setup.
The challenging part of this project is proper preprocessing of the images before training so that our model capture differential features.
